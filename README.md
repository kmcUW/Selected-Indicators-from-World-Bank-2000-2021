These data are a collection of 34 "Indicator" statistics for populations in countries around the world. The data were originally collected by the World Bank, then were selected and compiled into a dataset by Robert Lofaro on Kaggle. 
This main content of this repository consists of 3 CSV files:
- facttable.csv contains the main data on the indicator statistics for each nation
- dimension_indicator.csv explains the indicator abbreviations and meanings
- dimension_country.csv is a reference for the abbreviation of each nation included in the dataset

The repository also contains this README and a Metadata file in DataCite standard XML format
